# Today In My City

TodayInMyCity is a simple web page that pulls information about
the current location you're in, currently weather and nearby
meetup events. This is written using Node, and is set up to
run on RedHat's OpenShift PaaS.

As a sidenote to anyone viewing the code, this was a "let's learn
JavaScript and Node" project so the code is in need of some work.
It will get cleaned up in time.
